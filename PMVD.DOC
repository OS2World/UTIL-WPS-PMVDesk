 
 PM VIRTUAL DESKTOP (PMVDesk) FOR OS/2 2.X
 ==========================================
 Version: 0.25 (previous version: PMVDesk ver 0.21) 
 Date:    January 3, 1994
 Author:  Carrick von Schoultz, cschoult@aton.abo.fi
 
 
 Introduction
 -------------
 This is the documentation for the PMVDesk. I recommend that you
 read it!
 (At least have a look at the "Environment variable" section.)
 
 PMVDesk is a Virtual Desktop utility for the OS/2 2.x Workplace Shell. 
 When you start the program you will see a 9 button grid. Each button 
 represents a screen (of your current videoadapter resolution). The 
 current screen is marked with an "X". 
 
 When you press one of the buttons (move the cursor over it and click 
 mouse button 1) you move to that virtual location. (In this version 
 you can not see your open windows in the PMVDesk application, ...but 
 just wait for the future versions). Your Workplace Shell Desktop 
 (icons) will always be visible. This way you can easily get hold of
 those objects (where ever you are). 
 
 Features
 ---------

"Options" menu:

 - Uncheck "Frame controls" to hide title and menu bars.
   You can also use Alt-F.

 - Check "Float on top" to keep PMVDesk the topmost window. Uncheck to
   let it behave as a normal window. You can also use Alt-T.
 
 - Check "Retrieve windows on exit" to retrieve windows back to
   the active desktop when you exit PMVDesk. 
   Note. Retrieved windows are hidden. To activate: select application
   from Workplace Shell "Window List". Only windows with child windows
   (ex. dialog windows) are retrieved visible.

 - "Buttons" + "2 x 2", "3 x 3" or "4 x 4" changes the size of your
   virtual desktop.

 - "Util" + "Retrieve windows" to retrieve windows back to the active
   desktop. 
   Note. Retrieved windows are hidden. To activate: select application
   from Workplace Shell "Window List". Only windows with child windows
   (ex. dialog windows) are retrieved visible.

 "Help" menu:
 Standard "Help" menu. You can also use F1 to activate help.

 System menu:
 Standard system menu.

 Popup menu:
 To activate press mouse button 2, or press SHIFT + F10 (when PMVDesk is
 active). Same features as in "Options" menu + "Help" menu and some
 features from the system menu.

 To move the PMVDesk window (when frames are hidden), select "Move"
 from the popup menu "Window" submenu, or press ALT-F7.

 Choose any application from the "Window List", and it will be shown in
 the visible area.

 Choose "Retrieve windows" from PMVDesk "Options" + "Util" menu to
 bring all windows to the lover left corner of the visible area.
 Windows that were moved are now hidden. To get them visible, just
 choose them from the "Window List".

 By hiding the title and menu bars and resizing the window, you can
 position PMVDesk for example in the lower corner of the screen, and so
 out of the way.
 
 Environment variable
 ---------------------
 PMVDesk uses a environment variable: PMVDESK_INI. This variable
 specifies the filename (including full path) that PMVDesk should use
 for storing its options. If this environment variable is not set,
 PMVDesk will create the file PMVDESK.INI in the current directory
 and store its information there. I recommend that you put the line:

 SET PMVDESK_INI=C:\OS2\PMVDESK.INI

 in your CONFIG.SYS (Of course, you can use any other path or filename
 that you want). By doing this you avoid multiple copies of PMVDESK.INI
 scattered around your hard drive.
 You will have to reboot before this line will take effect.

 PMVDesk will "remember" it's last position and virtual screen. If you 
 put a PMVDesk Program Object in your startup folder, it will start where 
 you last left it. You may also "Shutdown" your system without closing 
 PMVDesk (because "Shutdown" closes it for you). Remember to put the 
 line SET RESTARTOBJECTS=STARTUPFOLDERSONLY, in your CONFIG.SYS
 file before SET AUTOSTART=PROGRAMS, TASKLIST, FOLDERS, CONNECTIONS.
 
 Troubleshooting
 ----------------
 Recovering "lost" windows: 
 - Choose "Retrieve windows" from PMVDesk "Settings" menu to
   bring all windows to the lover left corner of the visible area.
   Note. Retrieved windows are hidden. To activate: select application
   from Workplace Shell "Window List". Only windows with child windows
  (ex. dialog windows) are retrieved visible.
 - you may choose the "lost" program from Workplace Shell "Window List"
   and cascade the program back to the visible area (press mouse button
   2, choose "Cascade").

 Limitations
 ------------
 This version supports up to 100 open windows.
 It is possible to start only one instance of PMVDesk. A warning
 dialog informs you if you try to start a second instance.
 
 Starting the program
 ---------------------
 To start PMVDesk, double click on the program object.
 
 Program requirements
 ---------------------
 To use PMVDesk, you must be running OS/2 2.0 (or later), and of
 course Workplace Shell as your shell. 
 
                            *      *      *
 
 Registering
 ------------
 PM Virtual Desktop is in its current version a freeware program. 
 As this is not the final version, I do not require you to register 
 it even if you should choose to keep and use it. However, it would be 
 nice to get a postcard from your part of the world! 
 
 Since this version of PMVDesk is freeware, you are permitted
 (and encouraged) to pass on the file PMVD???.ZIP. You may NOT 
 modify this file (or its individual components) before passing it on.

 Why I wrote PMVDesk
 --------------------
 Since nobody had yet released a Virtual Desktop utility, and I find my 
 screen a little tiny. I also had to write a program as an assignment 
 for my C-language course at school, and had the opportunity to choose 
 what to do. I also wanted to learn about writing OS/2 Workplace Shell 
 compliant programs, and this was the hard way. 
 Any further enhancements (after version 0.11) are made just to keep you
 happy, ...and to keep me busy.

 History
 --------
 PMVDesk was first released as "CvS - Virtual Screen". I changed the name,
 to avoid confusion, when I was told there is a CVS (Concurrent Versioning
 System) application.
 See "new.doc" for new features introduced and bugs corrected, and some
 problems not yet solved.
