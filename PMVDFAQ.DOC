 PMVDesk frequently asked questions
 ===================================

 What does PMVDesk do to my system and windows?
 -----------------------------------------------
 PMVDesk only moves/repositions your windows, nothing else!
 
 The "Sticky" feature usually works fine, but sometimes 
 if I close PMVDesk and restart, the "Sticky" feature 
 will not be saved on some windows. Why?
 -------------------------------------------------------
 I implemented the saving of "sticky" windows by querying the 
 frame window title. If your window has not got a frame window 
 title, then PMVDesk can not store its data.

 The "Sticky" feature usually works fine, but sometimes if I 
 close PMVDesk and restart, the "Sticky" feature will affect 
 windows that I have not assigned "Sticky". Why?
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 I implemented the saving of "sticky" windows by querying the 
 frame window title. If your window has the same title as some
 other window (that is assigned "Sticky"), then your window is
 also assigned sticky.

 How did you implement PMVDesk?
 ------------------------------
 First I enumerate all your wisible windows, and query their
 size and position. I create a tiny window representing your
 window, divide the size of the original by the value selected
 in "Scale" an position this window in PMVDesk window. I store 
 the window handle, and the eqvivalent window handle of my tiny 
 window in to an array, so I can later find the corresponding
 windows.
 When you move the tiny window in PMVDesk, PMVDesk repositions
 your window to the new position. When you move your original
 window a input hook checks if your action should affect the
 the tiny window in PMVDesk. If you close or start an application, 
 the input hook checks if some action is needed in PMVDesk.
