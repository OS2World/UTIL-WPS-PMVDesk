 Beginners guide using virtual desktop applications  (June 20, 1993)
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 Usually you work with several windows at the same time, but often find
 that it would be nice to have a bigger screen, so you could see all
 your windows. Then you have a look in your wallet, and find no many,
 and no credit for your credit card. This is when you need a cheap
 (read: free) virtual desktop to emulate a big screen.
 My implementation is not perfect (and not the final version), but
 gives you nine screens where you can open different windows, and
 easily jump between these screens, just by pressing one of the
 buttons.

 example:
 - start PMVDesk.
  (you see a X on the middle button, so this represents the current
   screen)
 - open a window, or a program (it opens normally)
 - press the lower left button on PMVDesk
  (your open windows seems to disappear, and you have a clean screen.
   Do not worry, your windows are still there, just press the middle
   button and you are back where you started)
 - in this new screen you may open new windows and programs
 - to quickly return back just press that button on PMVDesk that
   represents the screen where you want to go to

 So, this is how you use a virtual desktop.
 There are different kinds of virtual desktop applications, with fancy
 miniature windows representing your windows, and that might be my
 final goal when I continue developing my application.
